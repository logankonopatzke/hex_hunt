# Hex Hunt

## Platforms
Hex Hunt was designed with the idea of being cross platform using abstraction. Hex Hunt shouldâ„¢ work on Windows however, I have not tested it on any Windows systems and I cannot verify that it works on anything other than Ubuntu.

Hex Hunt is an interactive console based mini game that was designed for the AP CompSci 'Create' exam. Created by Logan Konopatzke.
